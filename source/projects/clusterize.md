description: Tiny JavaScript plugin to display large data sets easily. The main idea is not to pollute DOM with all used tags.
---

The main idea is not to pollute DOM with all used tags. Instead of that - 
it splits the list to clusters, then shows elements for current scroll 
position and adds extra rows to top and bottom of the list to emulate 
full height of table so that browser shows scrollbar as for full list.

#### Features Overview

* Adaptive virtual scrolling
* Support for millions of rows
* Support for any tag (table, ul, ol, div...)
* Support for mobiles and tablets
* Support for all modern browsers (IE8+)
* Only 2.3KB gzipped
